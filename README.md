## Troubleshooting FAQ

### What is Mouse Shaker’s privacy policy?
We don’t collect any data.

### Why is it asking me to give permissions?
In order to simulate clicks and move the cursor on your behalf, you need to give the app the accessibility permissions. Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility -> Check Mouse Shaker app.

### Why is the click not working?
In order for the click to work, you need to make sure to give the app the accessibility privileges. Please, see question above for how to do that.

### Why are there different modes?
Zen is obviously the less intrusive as it doesn’t move the cursor and simulates activity, very much like the well-known app on Windows. Unfortunately, some apps got a little fancier at detecting activity and sometimes check if the cursor has moved or if a click occurred. So we have 3 modes to cover all cases.

### Where does the click occur?
Click occurs wherever the cursor was left at or at a defined location. Go to Preferences to configure it your way.

### Can I use my computer while Mouse Shaker is enabled?
Yes. The app will only simulate activity if it detects inactivity.

### How frequently is activity simulated?
Default is every 30s but you can change the frequency in the Preferences.
